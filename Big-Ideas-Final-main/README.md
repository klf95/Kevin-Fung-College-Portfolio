Data Sets:
Police:https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data
The police data set shows all the crime incident reports in all the neighborhoods around Allegheny County. It tells of the locations and the incidents reported at said locations. Is a great way to tell what the safest neighborhood is.

Trees: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees/resource/1515a93c-73e3-4425-9b35-1cd11b2196da
This data set about all the trees in Pittsburgh contains a lot of relevant and useful information. It includes the type of tree, height and width, as well as the location (street name, neighborhood, even different police and fire zones). It also has the benefits in dollar values for different categories, such as electricity and gas energy benefits or stormwater benefits.

Population:



Abstract: We determined Squirrel Hill North as the best Neighborhood since it is 4th best in population, 4th best in trees, and is only the 29th highest in crime rates. From this it is easy to see why it is the best it has the best population to crime ratio and has some very nice trees in the area.
